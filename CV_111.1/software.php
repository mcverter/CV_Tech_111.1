            Portfolio Projects:
            -------------------
            PERL/cgi .  Moving  to Laravel
            http://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/squat/index.html


            LANGUAGES:


            PHP
            ------
            ** I prefer the structure of object-orientation.
            *PERL
            **I spent many years with PERL5
            ** Two years ShortCycles was OOPerl5,

            C/C++
            ------
            3 years coding C/C++
            I prefer the strictness of C.
            C is cool
            Took Class System V Unix commands


            Core Java:

            PYTHON:
            --------------
            *Transitioned to Python from Java
            **Quick Prototypying:  Java too byzantine

            *My python is not yet pythonic.  I
            ** Don't use lambda statements
            ** Write for loops instead of list comprehension

            Javascript is still a bit mysterious to me.  I considered it just an Object Oriented language,
            but am now beginning to appreciate the complexity of the language .
