	PYTHON:
	--------------
	*Transitioned to Python from Java
	**Quick Prototypying:  Java too byzantine

	*My python is not yet pythonic.  I
	** Don't use lambda statements
	** Write for loops instead of list comprehension

	Javascript is still a bit mysterious to me.  I considered it just an Object Oriented language,
	but am now beginning to appreciate the complexity of the language .
